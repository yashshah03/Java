**The project is developed using Apache Netbeans IDE 10.0, Java 8, Windows 10**

## Features:
   - [X] Generic support (Can be used with any data types)
   - [X] Thread safe

## Methods:
   - insert(value)
     * Inserts the given value in BST
   - search(value)
     * Search for the given value in BST
   - get(value)
     * Retreive the node with given value, if exists
   - delete(value)
     * Delete the node with given value
   - getMinimum()
     * Get minimum value in BST
   - getMinimum(BinaryTreeNode)
     * Get minimum value in sub-tree rooted at given Node within BST
   - getInOrder() 
     * Get all nodes in the BST represted as a String from an In-Order travarsal
   - getPreOrder() 
     * Get all nodes in the BST represted as a String from a Pre-Order travarsal
   - getPostOrder() 
     * Get all nodes in the BST represted as a String from a Post-Order travarsal
