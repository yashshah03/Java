## This project contains sample implementation of a stack in java
   **The project is developed using Apache Netbeans IDE 10.0, Java 8, Windows 10, Junit4.12**

**_This project uses my implementation of a [LinkedList](https://github.com/yashshah03/Java/tree/master/DataStructures/LinkedList) as the base DataStructure._**

## Features:
