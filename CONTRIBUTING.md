# How to contribute

## Did you find a bug?
  * Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug unless you'vr ensured the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.
  * If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
  * If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and paste the content into the issue description.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
  * Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
  * Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
  * Before submitting, please make sure to follow coding conventions and benchmarks.

## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?
Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?
   * Suggest your change in the mailing list (_coming soon_) and start writing code.
   * Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

Thanks! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
