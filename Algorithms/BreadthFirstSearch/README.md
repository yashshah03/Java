## This project contains sample implementation of BFS in java
   **The project is developed using Apache Netbeans IDE 10.0, Java 8, Windows 10**

**_This project uses my implementation of [Graph](https://github.com/yashshah03/Java/tree/master/DataStructures/Graph) 
and [Queue](https://github.com/yashshah03/Java/tree/master/DataStructures/Queue) as the base DataStructure._**

## Methods:
   - setGraph(Graph)
     * Set the graph to use the BFS algorithm on
   - search(value)
     * Breadth First Search for the given value in the graph
