## This project contains sample implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in java
   **The project is developed using Apache Netbeans IDE 10.0, Java 8, Windows 10**

**_This project uses my implementation of a [Graph](https://github.com/yashshah03/Java/tree/master/DataStructures/Graph) as the base DataStructure._**

## Features:
   - [X] [Custom Exception](https://github.com/yashshah03/Java/tree/master/CustomException)

## Methods:
   - setGraph(Graph)
     * Set the graph to use the Dijkstra's algorithm on
   - setSource(source)
     * Set source node for the graph
   - calculateShortestDistnaces()
     * Calculate minimum distance of all nodes from source
   - printOutput()
     * Print paths to all nodes from source
